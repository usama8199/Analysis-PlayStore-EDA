# Analysis-PlayStore-EDA

## Overview
- Cleaned the data using python libraries like numpy and pandas
- Performed EDA and statistical analysis using numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn

## Problem Statement

Google Play Store team is about to launch a new feature where in certain apps that are
promising are boosted in visibility. The boost will manifest in multiple ways – higher priority in
recommendations sections (“Similar apps”, “You might also like”, “New and updated games”).
These will also get a boost in visibility in search results. This feature will help bring more
attention to newer apps that have potential.
The task is to understand what makes an app perform well - size? price? category? multiple
factors together? Analyze the data and present your insights in a format consumable by
business – the final output of the analysis would be presented to business as insights with
supporting data/visualizations.

## Insights
1. Distribution of Ratings is a Left skewed distribution (Mean is smaller than median) as Most of the ratings are between 4-4.5 so most of the app perform well 
2. Most of the app are from 15mb to 40mb and as we know all the rating of apps are quiet well of 4-4.5 
3. As the free apps removed we get a clear idea and here we can conclude that paid apps are highly rated 
4. Most of the priced items are of lesser size so we can say that People prefer to pay for app of lesser size or app are designed in such a way that they are not bulky 
5. We can conclude from this is that bulky app may not perform well in the market 
6. We can see that at an average all the ratings are nearly the same (close to 4) irrespective of the content rating 
7. Mature 17+ it looks like they are lower than others 
8. Well known apps(more reviews) gets higher ratings
